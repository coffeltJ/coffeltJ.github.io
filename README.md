**Salutations!!!** <img align="right" width="220" height="220" src="/assets/IMG/template_logo.png">

My name is Jared Coffelt, I am second-year PhD student at UCLA's Institute of Environment and Sustainability. I am passionate about social and environmental justice, fascinated by clean energy technology, and enjoy discussions on society, culture, and human nature. My research interests lie in the interactions between physical and social (e.g. institutions, laws, policies, cultural customs, economies, etc.) infrastructure and how society can advance or hinder the integration of technology and how technology influences how we organize our communities. My non-academic hobbies include: exploring the city, reading, writing, and (hopefully) playing/writing more music.

## What is this page?

This page was originally built to host my final project for my Introduction to Machine Learning for Physical Sciences course. While that will be its primary purpose for now, it is likely to evolve over time, and perhaps may come to be a home to other writings and projects I wish to share with the world.

## The Final Project
For my final project, I utilized a dataset containining data on various characteristics of nearly 4,500 undergraduate students at the Polytechnic Insitute of Portalegre, Portugal. I apply three different classifier machine learning models to this data to determine relationships between the characteristics and academic success. 

You can find the report [here](assets/Coffelt_Final_Project_Report_(1).pdf)

and the code [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EgkMPqkqtLmrOZYlbSGCjYLyC3LXV7y0?usp=sharing)

### How to change the theme (optional)
1.	You can choose any theme [listed on this page](https://pages.github.com/themes/), though some do not work as well on mobile devices.
2.	From GitHub, edit `_config.yml` and replace the `theme:` line with `theme: jekyll-theme-name` where `name` is the name of the theme from the above list. **For the `minima` theme, use a shortened preface like so `theme: minima`**, the others seem to need the whole preface `theme: jekyll-theme-`. You can check the *Actions* tab (as in step 6. above) to make sure the site is building successfully.

### How to change your site logo (optional)
1. Some themes, such as `jekyll-theme-minimal`, show a logo. In your repository, upload a logo or profile picture to the `assets/IMG/` directory
2. Open `_config.yml` and modify the line `logo: /assets/IMG/template_logo.png` to point to your new image

## Guide to Adding Content
* Your repository's `README.md` file (the file you are reading now) acts like a home page. Replace its contents with whatever you want the world to see by editing the file on GitHub.
* If you want to turn this page into a CV or blog, etc., it may be useful to refer to a [guide for writing Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
* You can create other markdown files (.md) in your repository and navigate to them from this page using links, i.e.: [here is a link to another file, `project.md`](project.md)
* When editing a markdown file on GitHub, it is useful to wrap text by selecting the *Soft wrap* option as shown: ![screenshot](/assets/IMG/instr_wrap.png)
* If you want to get even more technical, you can also write HTML in your .md files, and GitHub Pages will render it. For example, the image below is displayed by writing the following (edit this file to see!): `<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="/assets/IMG/template_frog.png">`
